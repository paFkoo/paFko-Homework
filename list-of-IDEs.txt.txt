1.Eclipse - Is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio. The interface 
is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the 
.Net Framework. Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is 
fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.

2.Netbeans - The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it 
compiles code which is a bonus. When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish 
that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment. This server is the second biggest 
server for Java next to WebSphere 

3.gedit - gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup.
Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects. 
This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.

4.Code::Blocks - Code::Blocks, which is built on the wxWidgets framework, is exceptionally lightweight in size, 
yet still quite functional and feature-rich IDE. You can load up a number of under-the-hood compiler engines, 
ranging from GCC and LLVM, to Digital Mars and Open Watcom. Code::Blocks also takes advantage of multi-core 
compiling, allowing you to get the job done faster. Code::Blocks is distributed under the GPL v3.0 license 
which means it can be used freely by anyone.

5.Aptana Studio - Aptana is well suited for web and scripting languages. PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python are 
supported as well as the likes of Adobe AIR. Even the studio itself is available as a plugin for Eclipse 
if you prefer the way Aptana handles your work and want to combine it with a more comprehensive IDE. 
Aptana Studio is free and available solely under the GNU General Public License.
